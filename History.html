          <h2> Historical Background</h2>
          <p> 
             The name Stellenbosch first appears in history in 1679 when Simon Van der Stel, the Cape's govenor of the time, named a tiny
            island in the Eerste River. However, it may be pressumed that several indigenous groups lived in the Stellenbosch are before it was officially named.
          </p>
          <p>
            After being found, Stellenbosch was rapidly recognized as a promising place for settlement and agriculture. The region around the Cape of Good Hope
            appeared to have fertile soil and an ideal environment for growing vegetables to feed the ships passing by on thier way to the other places in the East.
            The thirst of the Dutch and the other settlers who demanded fine wine, and so Stellenbosch quickly found its hills and valleys covered in vineyards and various other crops.
